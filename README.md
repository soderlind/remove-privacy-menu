# Remove Privacy Menu in WordPress 4.9.6+

## Why ?

On a WordPress Multisite you will most likely point to a single privacy policy page using the `privacy_policy_url` or `the_privacy_policy_link` filters, and hence you don't want to display the `Settings->Policy` page on each subsite/wp-admin.

### Sidenote

The pluging will also remove the privacy menu on a WordPress single site.

## How

Copy the plugin file into your `wp-content/mu-plugins` folder.
